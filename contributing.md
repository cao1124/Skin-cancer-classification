# Contributing guidelines
As you may know, maintaining a project is time-consuming, especially for a small team in which everyone has limited time. Therefore, to best help you get through your questions and help you contribute to the project, we have this guidelines that we ask you to read before putting issues/pull requests. Please guide yourself through the sections and act in accord with your intention and situation.

## About our response
As mentioned in README, we have a large codebase with complicated code and many unnecessary features. Therefore, to make the code clean and fast, @TonyLianLong re-implemented the code according to what is reported and published several months ago, based on a pytorch template that is commonly used (victoresque/pytorch-template), when our method is nearly finalized.
This implementation, however, could contain problems for your use cases, although it works on our end. Please act according to the guides below. Note that since this project is not our main goal/focus, it's possible that we miss your message, especially issues which can easily disappear with neumorous github notifications. Please look at existing issues before submitting new ones, and email us directly if you need help and we did not notice your issues.

We plan to act in this schedule which spans half a year until the repository is finalized:
1. Phase 1: we accept any questions/PR, including general questions/implementation-related questions/help request that involves interactive debugging. This will take about 1 month. We will try our best to respond in our spare time.
2. Phase 2: we still accept questions/PR including the ones about general questions and implementation-related questions. We will not guarantee to process help request that asks us to help debug your runs anymore as it takes a lot of time. This will take about 2 months.
3. Phase 3: we will try our best to answer new questions but we will not provide guarantee to monitor the repository anymore since we have limited time and expect people to find their answers in the other issues. If you found a bug then fixed it, you can submit a PR and we are glad to respond to assist you. If you have urgent issues, please contact us (through the instructions in README). This will take about 3 months.

## Specific situations
### I found a problem with the code and I'm able to fix it.
Thanks for your help! Please submit a pull request and we are happy to merge to fix problems for you and others.

### I found a problem with the code but I'm not able to fix it/I don't know where the problem is.
Please submit an issue for public message or contact us directly for coordination and we are happy to help you. See phases above for what we could help you with.

### I would like to contact the author directly instead of messages the author in public.
We recommend that you open an issue in this codebase, because your questions may help others. However, if you would like to contact us directly, feel free to send emails to `longlian at berkeley.edu` and `xdwang at eecs.berkeley.edu`.
